**Cyber engineer living at the intersection of infrastructure, security, and _“that doesn’t look right.”_**

Focused on:
- 🏗️ Infrastructure as Codee
- 🔐 Secure, zero-trust architecture
- 🏠 Self-hosted + hybrid-cloud infrastructure
- 🌍 Digital sovereignty
- 🧩 Finding problems other people miss

I like systems that are **observable**, **reproducible**, and actually **owned by the people running them**.

- ❌ **Squashing at merge time is not fine**  
  _History and commit signing matter. Squash and sign before the PR :)_
- 🧱 **Terraform > Ansible**  
  _If Terraform can do it, Ansible is almost always the worse choice. Yeah... I'm looking at you, network engineers._
- 📦 **No IaC, no ownership**  
  _If it isn't deployed from source control with an auditable state, it's shadow tech._
