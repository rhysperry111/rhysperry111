### About me

**Cyber engineer living at the intersection of infrastructure, security, and _“that doesn’t look right.”_**

Focused on:
- 🏗️ Infrastructure as Codee
- 🔐 Secure, zero-trust architecture
- 🏠 Self-hosted + hybrid-cloud infrastructure
- 🌍 Digital sovereignty
- 🧩 Finding problems other people miss

I like systems that are **observable**, **reproducible**, and actually **owned by the people running them**.

### Hills I will die on 

- ❌ **Squashing at merge time is not fine**
  
  _History and commit signing matter._

- 🧱 **Terraform > Ansible**
  
  _If Terraform can do it, Ansible is almost always the worse choice._

- 📦 **No IaC, no ownership**
  
  _If it isn't deployed from source control, it's shadow tech._
