**Cyber engineer living at the intersection of infrastructure, security, and _“that doesn’t look right.”_**

Focused on:
- 🏗️ Infrastructure as Codee
- 🔐 Secure, zero-trust architecture
- 🏠 Self-hosted + hybrid-cloud infrastructure
- 🌍 Digital sovereignty
- 🧩 Finding problems other people miss

I like systems that are **observable**, **reproducible**, and actually **owned by the people running them**.
